After reviewing the KPIs, we have found that mostly customers churned due to competitor had better device offers, speed, and competitor offers more data. And there are many other issues found during the analysis. To improve them should follow following steps:
### We should work on speed, offers, and our technology first of all. After that, the second segment due to which customer has churned the organization is due to the attitude of customer service. And we have to improve the customer service to enhance the customer experience and build the trust.
### Analysis shows that churn is concentrated at both ends of the age spectrum. The highest churn rates occur among younger customers (under 30) and senior customers, particularly those aged 60 and above. For the senior user, we should include Minimal add on Priority queue for seniors During the customer service experience Offer in-store assistance for plan Recharge or troubleshooting Clear printed bill with Large font. To target our youth audience, we should include low-commitment plans which are low in price so youth can afford them, offer generous amount of data, app-based reward referral reports, creating a youth base by promoting and building their trust.
### Our analysis shows higher churn rates in certain states, likely driven by poor service quality or slow data speeds. To address this, we need to focus first on improving the quality and consistency of our network services in those state. To improve this, we should find network performance metrics. Pay attention to network problems in this particular area. Quick fix those problems and resolve the complaints. Local retailer and agent should also inform customer about these improvements. Launch loyalty bundles or discounts one service to stabilize the churn.
### Mid-range data users churn may be due to bill shock and price or performance concern. To improve this, monthly discounts or bonus after 6th or 12th month without late payment. Prioritize the state who has highest churn amount.
